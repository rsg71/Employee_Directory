## Description

An employee directory that allows users to make a search of employees within their organization. Employees are listed with their name, email, phone number, and date of birth; users may sort by their first name by clicking the "sort" button and keep clicking to reverse the sort order (ascending vs descending by first name). Furthermore, the input field allows users to search for employees and filter only the employees whose names contain the given search criteria. The table is made with 50 rows of test data but the functionality would apply for much larger data sets (for example, for companies of thousands of employees). This table would be useful for any company looking to make a clean, clear directory of their employees.
